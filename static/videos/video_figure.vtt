00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.254
VeasyGuide helps low vision learners
follow educational presentations.

2
00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:09.300
Using highlights and zoom,
we increase visual access to instructor actions.

3
00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:13.722
[VIDEO] Any position or a point is given with respect

4
00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.225
to a world or a universe coordinate system,

5
00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:20.979
and in this case it's denoted by the letter A.

6
00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.024
The position of.

7
00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:27.485
[NARRATION] In presentations, visual changes
convey information.

8
00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:31.489
They can signal important words
or expand on existing content.

9
00:00:31.906 --> 00:00:36.619
But for low vision learners, searching for visual
changes is especially demanding.

10
00:00:37.203 --> 00:00:41.833
Instructors can use pointers to guide learners
and digital pens to mark

11
00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:44.836
or even sketch more explanations on the slide.

12
00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:48.840
However, for low vision learners, pointing,
marking and sketching

13
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.844
activities are difficult to follow,
leading to the visual search problem.

14
00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.806
VeasyGuide is designed
to address the visual search problem.

15
00:00:57.057 --> 00:00:58.808
It has two main parts.

16
00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:01.895
Activity recognition and activity. Visualization.

17
00:01:02.103 --> 00:01:06.232
First to recognize activities,
VeasyGuide splits the video

18
00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:10.945
into segments of frames
using the first and last frames of every window,

19
00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:16.618
we calculate the visual difference,
resulting in regions of change marked in red.

20
00:01:16.826 --> 00:01:20.955
With a graph representing regions of change
over time, we recognize

21
00:01:20.955 --> 00:01:25.502
instructor activities using connected component
analysis marked in green.

22
00:01:26.419 --> 00:01:27.212
[VIDEO] Self driving cars.

23
00:01:29.214 --> 00:01:30.381
Like this one.

24
00:01:30.381 --> 00:01:33.384
Or creating images from text.

25
00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.179
[NARRATION] We describe the image and then

26
00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.348
we get the output. Something like this.

27
00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.769
VeasyGuide augments highlights over activities
with the ability to zoom in,

28
00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:46.439
with the zoom window
automatically following new activities.

29
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:54.072
[VIDEO] ...you can use traces of people driving the car to train self driving card.

30
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:57.367
And explanation...

31
00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:01.079
[NARRATION] Users can fully personalize their experience.

32
00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:04.999
VeasyGuide can adapt to individual
needs of low vision learners

33
00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.419
and different visual styles of presentation videos

34
00:02:10.421 --> 00:02:13.049
to explore the impact on low vision learners.

35
00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.763
We evaluated VeasyGuide with eight low vision
participants over two tasks and two conditions.

36
00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.227
Our findings show that using VeasyGuide, low
vision users are able to locate

37
00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:29.023
significantly more visual activities
with an increase of 33%

38
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.487
and doing that faster
with a reduction of 15% in visual search times.

39
00:02:34.863 --> 00:02:35.822
Additionally,

40
00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:38.825
the experience is improved when using VeasyGuide.

41
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.371
We significantly reduce cognitive load
when watching presentation videos

42
00:02:43.371 --> 00:02:46.374
by reducing the difficulty of visual search.

43
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.919
We conduct an additional evaluation
with eight sighted

44
00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:53.631
participants to explore its impact
on their learning experience.

45
00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:58.720
For sighted users,
using VeasyGuide makes it easier to pay attention

46
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.682
and focus on the learning content,

47
00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:06.227
demonstrating its potential
as a universal assistive tool.

48
00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:09.647
VeasyGuide has the potential
to seamlessly integrate

49
00:03:09.647 --> 00:03:13.860
into existing learning platform,
making them more accessible for all.
